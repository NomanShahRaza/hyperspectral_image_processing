# Hyperspectral Image Processing
## This repo inlcude all the basic step to read and process the Hyper Spectral Imagery (HSI).
* Read the Hyperspectral dataset (.mat file) using scipy.
* Display the hyperspectral image using spectral.
* Display any single band using matplotlib.
* Plot the spectral signature of any specific location.

## Note
* The hyperspectral dataset can be downloaded from the following link: http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php/Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes
* The spectral library can be downloaded from the following link: https://pypi.org/project/spectral/ 
* or 
* by using the following command "pip install spectral"
